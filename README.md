# BME VIK Chatbot - RAG Project

## Introduction
This project is part of my diploma/thesis at BME VIK. The aim is to develop a chatbot interface to assist BME VIK students with various inquiries. The chatbot, developed in Python, leverages advanced technologies to provide accurate and helpful responses to student queries.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
- To install the necessary libraries, please run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- This will install all the required packages to run the chatbot.
- Additionally, run the setup script: `python setup.py install`


### Running the Application
To start the chatbot, use the following command:`streamlit run chat.py`
This will initiate the Streamlit server and the chatbot interface should be accessible through a web browser.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Simply type your question into the chat input and the chatbot will respond with relevant information.
